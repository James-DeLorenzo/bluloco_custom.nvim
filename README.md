A Lush Theme for Neovim.
===

See: http://git.io/lush.nvim for more information on Lush and a helper script
to setup your repo clone.

For VS Code I use the [bluloco dark theme](https://github.com/uloco/theme-bluloco-dark/), and I wanted the same theme when setting up neovim (with some opinionated/extra colors for things).


This theme requires [lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim/) to load out of the box, using your favorite plugin manager to help with that.
I also exported the theme to vimscript using [Shipwright](https://github.com/rktjmp/shipwright.nvim/) located in `bluloco_custom/colors/bluloco_custom.vim`
